# Instructions

## Python server
First open the pyFlaskProject folder (preferably in PyCharm). If you are using PyCharm, click Run. Otherwise you can also use the terminal and type `python main.py`.

## Angular app
Now open the webApp folder and run first `npm install` and then `ionic serve` (or `ng serve` or even `npm start` for that matter).

# Notes
The _Reference_ folder contains the code that was originally published by W.M. Kouadri at https://github.com/AbCd256/Quality-of-sentiment-analysis-tools, and my adaptations for the same containing a few extracted comments and results.
