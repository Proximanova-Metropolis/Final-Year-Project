Hi Soham,

Glad to know that you have enjoyed the DB course. Thanks for your kind words ðŸ˜Š

Regarding your FYP, you are behind schedule. Its high time you start implementing the project. Yes you need to develop on top of the Kandinsky mobile code given to you. Basically, you need to take the code of different techniques discussed in the experimental study paper sent to you earlier (the authors should have a github link for the code used in their study), run them on different Youtube data sets, and do comparative visual analysis of sentiments on Kandinsky mobile generated by these algorithms. Given that different algorithms may generate different sentiments for the same text, you need to think of ways to convey this information visually in Kandinsky mobile for different Youtube datasets. Once you have the framework working, then you can do more insightful analysis of sentiments coming out from various youtube videos. First thing is to get the framework for comparative visualization working.

Happy new year!

Best,

Sourav
